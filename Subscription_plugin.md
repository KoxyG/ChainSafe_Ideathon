# Subscription Plugin Ideathon Proposal

## Overview
The Subscription Plugin is designed to facilitate subscription-based services within the Ethereum ecosystem. It enables users to subscribe to various services by making payments in native currency. This plugin enhances the functionality of Ethereum-based projects by providing a seamless subscription mechanism.

## How does the project work?
The Subscription Plugin allows users to subscribe to services by calling the `subscribe` function with the service address and subscription amount. This creates a mapping of subscriptions, storing essential information such as the subscription amount, last payment timestamp, and subscription status. Additionally, the `collect` function enables the collection of subscription payments and triggers the execution of associated functions in external contracts.

### Problem Solving
- Enables subscription-based services on the Ethereum blockchain.
- Enhances project functionality by providing a standardized subscription mechanism.

### DevEx Improvement
- Simplifies the implementation of subscription services within Ethereum projects.
- Streamlines payment processing and subscription management.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for managing subscriptions, improving the overall developer experience.

### Gas Optimization
- Optimizes gas usage by providing a streamlined subscription mechanism.
- Reduces the gas costs associated with managing subscription payments and validation.

## Features

### Storage
- **Subscription Data**: Stores information about subscribed users, including subscription amount, last payment timestamp, and subscription status.

### Functions

#### `subscribe(address service, uint256 amount) external`
Description: Allows users to subscribe to services by specifying the service address and subscription amount.

Steps:
1. Receives the service address and subscription amount as parameters.
2. Creates a subscription record for the user with the specified service and amount.
3. Sets the subscription status to enabled.

#### `collect(address subscriber, uint256 amount) external`
Description: Collects subscription payments and triggers associated functions in external contracts.

Steps:
1. Retrieves the subscription data for the subscriber.
2. Validates the subscription amount and payment frequency.
3. Executes associated functions in external contracts using the `executeFromPluginExternal` method.

## Category
- [x] Project Plugin: Plugin designed for a specific project.

## Use Cases
- **Developer Experience**: Simplifies the integration of subscription-based services into Ethereum projects.
- **Gas Optimization**: Optimizes gas usage by providing a streamlined subscription mechanism.
- **Security**: Enhances security by ensuring that only authorized users can access subscription-based services.

## Usage (Before & After Plugin)
Before implementing the Subscription Plugin, projects would need to develop custom subscription systems, leading to increased development time and complexity. However, after integrating the plugin, projects can easily incorporate subscription-based services, improving developer experience and project functionality.
